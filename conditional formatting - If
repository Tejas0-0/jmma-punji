'''
a toy vendor supplies three types of toys: battery based toys, keybased toys and electrical charging based toys.
the vendor gives a discount of 10% on orders for battery based toys if the order is for than rs. 1000. On orders
of more than rs. 100 for key based toys, a discount of 5% is given and a discount of 10% is given on orders for 
electrical charging based toys of value more than rs. 500. Assume that the numeric codes 1,2 and 3 are used for 
battery based toys, key based toys and electrical charging based toys respectively. write a program that reads 
the product code and the order amount and prints out the net amount that the customer is required to pay after the discount.'''
